# System of linear equations

##

**Example**

Luis went yesterday to the bank to find out the interest rate of three different financial instruments. He received the following information:

| Financial Instrument | Savings Account | Certified Deposit | Bonds |
| -------------------- | --------------- | ----------------- | ----- |
| Annual Interest      | 2%              | 3%                | 4%    |

He wants to invest his USD $10,000 savings in these three accounts. By doing so, he knows that after a year he would receive a total of US $ 260 in interest if he put twice as much money in the savings account as in the CDs, and “z” money in bonds.

Calculate the value of “z” , in USD, using the elimination method explained in the lectures.

**Solution**

We need to transform the question/statements into a system of equations based
on what we know.

- x + y + z = 10000
- x -2y = 0 since we have twice as much in savings as in certified deposit
- 0.02x + 0.03y + 0.04z = 260

This is our three pieces of information.
